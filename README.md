# PredictionOfHealthExpense
Prediction of health expense of an individual for an insurance company. 
In this machine learning project we help insurance companies predict expense of their customers.
We have used three different regression algorithms for creating machine learning models.
Linear regression, Random forest, Gradient boosting are the algorithms used.
Gradient boosting shows the highest accuracy among the algorithms.
